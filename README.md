# DataOps: Churn Analysis & Engagement

DataOps is a platform created to demonstrate how to predict and reduce customer churn. This repository outlines an end-to-end solution leveraging modern data and AI tools, plus minimal-code automation.

---

## Overview

**Goal**: Monitor and predict user churn, then take proactive steps (e.g., sending personalized offers) to retain subscribers.

### Architecture Highlights

- **MongoDB** for storing raw user activity and subscription data.  
- **Apache Spark** for scalable data processing and feature engineering.  
- **Airflow** to orchestrate data pipelines and model training schedules.  
- **FastAPI** to serve real-time churn predictions via a REST API.  
- **Docker & Kubernetes** for containerization and deployment at scale.  
- **n8n / Zapier** to automate data ingestion and user notifications without heavy coding.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Ingestion
- Payment logs from Stripe/PayPal.  
- User activity logs (e.g., course progress, quiz completions).  
- Support tickets, survey results, and other engagement data.  
- Automated workflows (**n8n/Zapier**) to pull data from SaaS tools into MongoDB.

### 2. Data Processing & Feature Engineering
- **Spark jobs** (triggered by Airflow) clean and aggregate data.  
- Feature sets (e.g., average session length, quiz scores, time since last login) stored for modeling.

### 3. Model Training & Tracking
- **Churn prediction model** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) trained in scheduled Airflow tasks.  
- **MLflow** (optional) for experiment tracking and model versioning.

### 4. Model Serving
- **FastAPI** microservice wrapped in Docker.  
- Deployed on Kubernetes for auto-scaling and reliable real-time inference.

### 5. Automation & Notifications
- **n8n/Zapier** workflows notify customer success teams or send personalized emails when churn risk is high.  
- Continuous monitoring with **Prometheus/Grafana** to detect performance issues or model drift.
